## Question: Why was Meshery created?

**Answer**: _As an open source, vendor neutral project, Meshery was created out the necessity to enable service mesh adopters to overcome the challenge of complex virtual networking; to come to expect more from their infrastructure; to enable the world to understand and operate any service mesh with confidence._
